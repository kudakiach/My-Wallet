My Wallet is an application for anyone of any age and occupation to manage their finances. Users will manually enter their earnings and spendings and see immediate balance changes. For usersâ€™ convenience, there will be two separate pages to manage their one-off and recurrent earnings and spendings. There will also be a report page where they can see analytics about their earnings and spendings for a period of time. My Wallet will have easy, intuitive navigation and user-friendly UI. We will store customer data in MongoDB.
